# cursedtypist

Simple typing game inspired by babytype written in python using curses and
asyncio.

## How to run

Install the python package as usual and run it:

```console
$ python3 -m cursedtypist
```

The game will be launched with the default text. If you want to use your custom
texts, pass the path as a command line argument:

```console
$ python3 -m cursedtypist --text $PATH_TO_YOUR_TEXT
```

Type the text as fast as possible to escape from lava and try to avoid mistakes.
